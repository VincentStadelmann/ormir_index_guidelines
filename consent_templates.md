# Consent forms

Here is a compilation of data sharing agreement sections that can be used for your study.

## **1. University of Calgary (Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board)- consent form wording**.

*Please note that this is not a “blanket” consent, but part of a study-specific consent form. If the participant agrees to use of the data in future research, a new ethics application would be required that describes the new study, and the source of data. However we are not required to ask each participant to reconsent if they have already agreed via the text below.*

USE OF DATA FOR FUTURE RESEARCH

It is your choice whether or not to let researchers share your data and biospecimens for research in the future. If you say “yes,” you can change your mind later, but your data and biospecimens might still be used if they have already been shared.

My de-identified research data may be kept for use in future research to learn about, prevent or treat other health-related problems.

YES

NO

## 2. Hamilton Health Sciences, Ontario, Canada

*Source: AMBERS Study*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Information from this study will be used for research purposes by AMBERS investigators and staff.  We will make every effort to minimize the possibility that any data obtained during this study can be traced back to you directly. Your identifiable information will not be shared with anyone except with your consent or as required by law. The data (the non-identifiable information collected for the study, including test and scan results and responses to the questionnaires) will be linked to the information that you previously provided during your participation in the XXXX studies.  The data will also be analyzed together with the data from several other bone health studies that have been conducted by Dr. XXXX and Dr. XXXX.  The de-identified data from the study may be used to help create a database of bone and muscle health that would be accessed by many different researchers internationally.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I authorize that my encrypted data from this research project may be used for medical research. 

I understand that the data is encrypted and that the key will be stored securely. The data can be sent to other databases in Switzerland and abroad for analysis if they adhere to the same standards as in Switzerland. All legal data protection requirements are complied with.

I make my decision voluntarily and can withdraw this decision at any time. If I withdraw, my data will be anonymized. I only inform the project management and do not have to justify this decision.

Normally, all data is evaluated as a whole and the results are published in summary form. If there is an important result for my health, it is possible that I will be contacted. If I do not wish to be contacted, I will inform the project management.

If results from the data are commercialized, I am not entitled to a share of the commercial use.
